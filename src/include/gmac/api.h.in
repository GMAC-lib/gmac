/** \mainpage Global Memory for ACcelerators (GMAC)
 *
 * \section intro_sec Code layout
 *
 * GMAC is organized in modules. There is an abstract front-end which
 * implements the public API offered to the programmers. These functions
 * use abstract classes that define the Backend API (kernel) and the Memory
 * Management API (memory). Finally, the available backends and memory managers
 * implement the functionality defined in their respective APIs. Currently,
 * the code is organized as follows:
 * \verbatim
 * src/                 - GMAC root directory
 * src/core/            - GMAC common abstractions
 * src/core/allocator   - Allocators used by the common abstractions
 * src/core/hpe         - GMAC common HPE abstractions
 * src/libs/            - Interception of user-level libraries
 * src/libs/mpi         - Optimized implementation of standard MPI functions
 * src/libs/posix       - Optimized implementation of standard POSIX functions
 * src/libs/stdc        - Optimized implementation of standard C library functions
 * src/hpe/             - HPE generic API calls and initialization
 * src/gmac/            - Frontend directory
 * src/include/         - Instalable include files
 * src/core/            - Backend API base classes
 * src/api/             - Backend root directory
 * src/api/cuda         - CUDA run-time backend
 * src/api/cuda/hpe     - CUDA run-time HPE implementation
 * src/api/opencl       - OpenCL run-time backend
 * src/api/opencl/hpe   - OpenCL run-time HPE implementation
 * src/memory/          - Memory API base classes
 * src/memory/allocator - Memory allocators used by the memory abstractions
 * src/memory/protocol  - Memory protocols
 * src/trace            - Tracing support
 * src/util             - Common utilities
 * tests/               - Tests used to validate GMAC \endverbatim
