\chapter{Building GMAC\slash CL Applications}

This chapter discusses how to use the OpenCL extensions provided by GMAC\slash CL\@. The programming 
of multi\hyp{}threaded and complex applications in GMAC\slash CL does only differ from OpenCL in the 
way data structures are allocated and passed to kernels. Hence, we only discuss these two topics in 
the context of the single\hyp{}threaded implementation of the same vector addition example used in 
Chapter~\ref{chapter:hpe}.
