\chapter{Building GMAC\slash HPE Applications}
\label{chapter:hpe}

This chapter discusses how to program applications using GMAC\slash HPE\@. First, simple 
single\hyp{}threaded applications are considered to introduce the basics of GMAC\slash HPE 
programming. Then, this chapter covers how to use GMAC in multi\hyp{}threaded and\slash or 
multi\hyp{}GPU applications, as well as how to efficiently use multi\hyp{}threading to overlap 
several tasks.
